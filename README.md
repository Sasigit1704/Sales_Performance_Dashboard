## üìù Project Description

### Data Preparation:
- Data was collected and cleaned using **Excel**. I created a synthetic dataset with sales transactions, customer details, product categories, and regional information.
- The dataset was used to analyze trends over the past two years.

### Power BI Visualizations:
- I created key visualizations such as KPI indicators, bar charts for product performance, and line graphs for revenue trends.
- Filter options were implemented to allow the user to view data by region, product, and time period.

### DAX Formulas:

- Created custom KPIs for tracking **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, and **Average Order Value**.
